# Message-Cryptography
This is a program coded in C++. Its main purpose is to encrypt, and decrypt messages. The user will be asked if they would like to encrypt or decrypt. After that the user will enter their message and will be asked for a key (number). In a case where the user encrypt's a message with the key 3, they could use the same key to decrypt the encrypted message back to normal.
